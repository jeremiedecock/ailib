This is an open source Markov Decision Processes framework written in Python.

Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) are a mathematical framework for modeling
sequential decision problems (multistage optimization) under uncertainty as
well as Reinforcement Learning problems.
This project implements classical algorithms to solve these problems (value
iteration, policy iteration, Qlearning, TD-learning, ...).
