Description
===========

This is a set of open source frameworks for Artificial Intelligence
(mostly machine learning and optimization).

This contains (among others):

-  a blackbox non linear noisy optimization framework;
-  a machine learning framework;
-  a multistage optimization and Markov Decision Process framework
   (Markov Decision Processes).

Note:

    This project is still in beta stage, so the API is not finalized yet.
